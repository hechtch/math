# Fibonacci calculation methods with benchmarks.

## Recursive: basic recursive algorithm to determine an arbitrary index of the sequence.

```
python recursive_fibonacci.py
```

## Const: Use the constant-time formula using Phi to approximate value without having access to other values.
```
python const_fibonacci.py
```

## Table: Build a table as you go - cheaper than recursive to determine a single instance.
```
python table_fibonacci.py
```
